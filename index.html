     <b> What Is Motivation?</b>
      <hr>
      &emsp;Motivation is the process that initiates, guides, and
      maintains goal-oriented behaviors.It is what causes you to act, whether
      it is getting a glass of water to reduce thirst or reading a book to gain
      knowledge. Motivation involves the biological, emotional, social, and
      cognitive forces that activate behavior. In everyday usage, the term
      "motivation" is frequently used to describe why a person does something.
      It is the driving force behind human actions. Motivation doesn't just
      refer to the factors that activate behaviors; it also involves the factors
      that direct and maintain these goal-directed actions<i>(though such motives
        are rarely directly observable)</i>. As a result, we often have to infer the
      reasons why people do the things that they do based on observable
      behaviors.1ï»¿
